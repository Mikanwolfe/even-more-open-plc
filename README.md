# Even More Open PLC

The goal of this small mini project is:

1. Write ESP32 firmware such that it can interpret Ladder Logic
2. Provide Debugging support for on-board PLC tags
3. Provide functionality to upload/download PLC code.

The "PLC Code" will be Allen-Bradley/Rockwell styled Ladder Logic
It won't be actual AB code but inspired by it.
