### Functional Description: Using a State Machine Architecture for Ladder Logic Parsing on a Microcontroller

#### Objective:
To implement a ladder logic parser on a microcontroller that can read and interpret Allen-Bradley (AB) styled strings continuously in real-time with efficiency and simplicity.

#### Overview:
A state machine architecture is chosen for this implementation due to its simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for the constrained environment of a microcontroller. The state machine approach allows the parser to process ladder logic elements one at a time in a linear, left-to-right manner, making it ideal for the real-time processing required in control systems.

#### Why Use a State Machine Architecture:

1. **Simplicity:**
   - A state machine is straightforward to implement and understand.
   - It allows for a clear definition of different states (e.g., XIC, XIO, OTE) and transitions between them based on the input string.

2. **Efficiency:**
   - State machines have minimal overhead, making them suitable for microcontrollers with limited computational power and memory.
   - The linear parsing of elements ensures that the logic is processed quickly and efficiently, meeting real-time constraints.

3. **Low Overhead:**
   - The state machine does not require complex data structures or additional memory allocations, conserving the microcontroller's limited resources.
   - It operates with a fixed set of states and transitions, avoiding the dynamic complexity that an abstract syntax tree (AST) might introduce.

4. **Real-time Processing:**
   - The state machine continuously reads and processes the ladder logic rungs in a loop, ensuring timely responses to input changes.
   - It can handle simple to moderately complex logic with ease, making it suitable for typical ladder logic tasks in control systems.

5. **Scalability for Moderate Complexity:**
   - While the state machine is primarily suited for simple logic, it can be extended to handle moderate complexity by adding more states and transitions.
   - This makes it versatile enough for various ladder logic applications without overwhelming the microcontroller.

#### Implementation Approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The ladder logic string is split into individual elements (e.g., "XIC", "XIO", "OTE").
   - The current position in the string is tracked to process each element sequentially.

2. **State Handling:**
   - For each element, the state machine transitions to the corresponding state and executes the associated parsing logic.
   - Example states include:
     - `XIC`: Examine if Closed
     - `XIO`: Examine if Open
     - `OTE`: Output Energize

3. **Continuous Parsing Loop:**
   - The parser runs in an infinite loop, continuously reading and interpreting the ladder logic rungs.
   - This ensures that the system remains responsive to changes in input conditions in real-time.

4. **Example Logic:**
   - The parsing logic is defined in simple methods corresponding to each state, allowing easy extension and maintenance.
   - The state machine transitions are straightforward, based on the current element being processed.

#### Conclusion:
Using a state machine architecture for ladder logic parsing on a microcontroller provides a balanced solution that meets the requirements of simplicity, efficiency, and real-time performance. It ensures that the parser can handle the ladder logic effectively without the complexity and overhead of more advanced data structures like an AST. This approach is well-suited for the constrained environment of a microcontroller, making it an ideal choice for real-time control systems.
